# Chapter 13: Searching and Sorting

In the last chapter, *Algorithms*, we learned several ways
of finding the two smallest values in a list. 
While this choice of example was somewhat arbitrary, the problem 
of organizing, storing and retrieving data is central to computer science. 

Searching and sorting data are two fundamental operations
and there exist several ways to perform these operations. 
We will compare several approaches, not only to show many solutions to
these particular problems, but to develop intuition for 
the way each computing approach uses memory and computing time. 


## Searching a List

Let's continue searching for values in a list. 
First, consider the built-in functions and methods available.
Python lists have a method called ```index```
that searches for a particular item. 


```python 
index(...)
    L.index(value, [start, [stop]]) -> integer -- return first index of value
``` 

It starts at the front of the list and examines each item in turn--a
technique called linear search. 
Linear search is used to find items in an *unsorted* list. 
If there are duplicate values, it finds the leftmost instance of ```value```:


```python 
>>> ['d', 'a', 'b', 'a'].index('a')
1
``` 

We'll walk through several versions of linear search to determine how to compare 
different algorithms that solve the same problem. 



### An Overview of Linear Search

Linear search starts at index zero and looks at each item one by one.
For each item, we ask this question:
Is this the value we are looking for at the current index?
We'll show three variations and they are all versions
of the function with this header and docstring. 

```python 
from typing import Any

def linear_search(lst: list, value: Any) -> int:
    """Return the index of the first occurrence of value in lst, or return
    -1 if value is not in lst.

    >>> linear_search([2, 5, 1, -3], 5)
    1
    >>> linear_search([2, 4, 2], 2)
    0
    >>> linear_search([2, 5, 1, -3], 4)
    -1
    >>> linear_search([], 5)
    -1
    """

    # examine the items at each index i in lst, starting at index 0:
    #    is lst[i] the value we are looking for?  if so, stop searching.

``` 


In the textbook, on page 245 to 246, you can see a visual description 
of the process of linear search. 
It shows a type of accounting exercise to keep track of what you have searched and what remains to be searched. 


#### The ```while``` Loop Version of Linear Learch

This is our first version of linear search. 
We will refine the commented lines to get them closer to Python commands.


```python 
from typing import Any

def linear_search(lst: list, value: Any) -> int:
    """Return the index of the first occurrence of value in lst, or return
    -1 if value is not in lst.

    >>> linear_search([2, 5, 1, -3], 5)
    1
    >>> linear_search([2, 4, 2], 2)
    0
    >>> linear_search([2, 5, 1, -3], 4)
    -1
    >>> linear_search([], 5)
    -1
    """
    
    i = 0 # The index in the next item in lst to examine.
    
    # While the unknown section isn't empty, and lst[i] isn't 
    # the value we are looking for:
    # add 1 to i
    

``` 
That is easier to translate. 
The unknown section is empty when ```i == len(lst)```, 
so it isn't empty ```while i != len(lst)```. 


```python 
from typing import Any

def linear_search(lst: list, value: Any) -> int:
    """Return the index of the first occurrence of value in lst, or return
    -1 if value is not in lst.

    >>> linear_search([2, 5, 1, -3], 5)
    1
    >>> linear_search([2, 4, 2], 2)
    0
    >>> linear_search([2, 5, 1, -3], 4)
    -1
    >>> linear_search([], 5)
    -1
    """

    i = 0  # The index of the next item in lst to examine.

    # Keep going until we reach the end of lst or until we find value.
    while i != len(lst) and lst[i] != value:
        i = i + 1

    # If we fell off the end of the list, we didn't find value.
    if i == len(lst):
        return -1
    else:
        return i

``` 

The extra code block is needed because the function terminates
in two situations:
either the ```value``` is found or we run out of values without finding ```value```. 
Notice that the second condition ```lst[i] != value```
terminates early when the ```value``` is found. 

If it goes to the end without finding ```value```, 
it returns ```-1``` to indicate that the search failed to find ```value```. 


#### The ```for``` Loop Version of Linear Learch

We could replace the ```while``` loop with a ```for``` loop
by introducing a ```return``` statement when the value is found. 
We might want to do this because the first ```while``` condition 
is almost never used, except when the ```value``` is not found. 

```python 
from typing import Any

def linear_search(lst: list, value: Any) -> int:
    """... Exactly the same docstring goes here ...
    """
    
    # For each index i in lst:
    #    If lst[i] is the value we are looking for:
    #       return i
    # 
    # If we get here, the value was not in lst, so we return -1. 

``` 

We can translate this into Python.

```python 
from typing import Any

def linear_search(lst: list, value: Any) -> int:
    """... Exactly the same docstring goes here ...
    """

    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if lst[i] == value:
            return i

    return -1

``` 

With the ```for``` loop, we no longer need the first ```while``` condition
because the ```for``` loop iterator controls the iteration. 
We also avoid incrementing the iterator ```i``` manually. 
Overall, this produces a faster algorithm, as we will see later. 


#### Sentinel Search

The last form of linear search we will study is called *sentinel search*. 
(A *sentinel* is a guard whose job it is to stand watch.)
Recall one problem with the ```while``` loop search 
is that we check ```i != len(lst)``` every iteration, 
even though it can never evaluate to ```False``` except at the end of the ```lst```. 

One trick we can use is to add the ```value``` to the end of the list
to guarantee that the ```value``` will be found. 
We do have to make sure to adjust the output in case the last item is the one we found. 


```python 
from typing import Any

def linear_search(lst: list, value: Any) -> int:
    """... Exactly the same docstring goes here ...
    """
    
    # Set up the sentinel: append value to end of list.
    
    i = 0 # The index of the next item in lst to examine.
    
    # While lst[i] isn't the value we are looking for:
    #   Add 1 to i
    
    # Remove the sentinel.
    
    return i

``` 

We also want to make sure that we clean up our mess:
we alter the list by ```append```ing a ```value```, 
so we need to remove it to preserve the contents of the original list.
In Python, the finished algorithm is: 

```python 
from typing import Any

def linear_search(lst: list, value: Any) -> int:
    """... Exactly the same docstring goes here ...
    """

    # Add the sentinel.
    lst.append(value)

    i = 0

    # Keep going until we find value.
    while lst[i] != value:
        i = i + 1

    # Remove the sentinel.
    lst.pop()

    # If we reached the end of the list we didn't find value.
    if i == len(lst):
        return -1
    else:
        return i

``` 

Note that all three of our searches are correct. 
Which one you prefer is largely a matter of taste. 
Some programmers dislike multiple return statements, with some buried
in the middle of the function. 
Others dislike modifying the inputs, for fear of introducing an error. 
Still, others dislike the added ```while``` condition that is rarely used. 

#### Timing the Searches

One way to settle the score is to compare them on timing.
Here is a program that compares the functions. 

```python 
import time
import linear_search_1
import linear_search_2
import linear_search_3

from typing import Callable, Any

def time_it(search: Callable[[list, Any], Any], L: list, v: Any) -> float:
    """Time how long it takes to run function search to find
    value v in list L.
    """

    t1 = time.perf_counter()
    search(L, v)
    t2 = time.perf_counter()
    return (t2 - t1) * 1000.0

def print_times(v: Any, L: list) -> None:
    """Print the number of milliseconds it takes for linear_search(v, L)
    to run for list.index, the while loop linear search, the for loop
    linear search, and sentinel search.
    """

    # Get list.index's running time.
    t1 = time.perf_counter()
    L.index(v)
    t2 = time.perf_counter()
    index_time = (t2 - t1) * 1000.0

    # Get the other three running times.
    while_time = time_it(linear_search_1.linear_search, L, v)
    for_time = time_it(linear_search_2.linear_search, L, v)
    sentinel_time = time_it(linear_search_3.linear_search, L, v)

    print("{0}\t{1:.2f}\t{2:.2f}\t{3:.2f}\t{4:.2f}".format(
            v, while_time, for_time, sentinel_time, index_time))

L = list(range(10000001))  # A list with just over ten million values

print_times(10, L)  # How fast is it to search near the beginning?
print_times(5000000, L)  # How fast is it to search near the middle?
print_times(10000000, L)  # How fast is it to search near the end?

``` 

As we did last week, we use the function ```perf_counter``` 
in the ```time``` module to compare performance. 
The function ```time_it``` will call whichever search function it's given
on ```v``` and ```L``` and return the time it took to complete the search. 
Function ```print_times``` calls ```time_it``` 
with the various linear search functions and prints those search times.

On my machine, it returned:

|  Length   |  while    |  for      | sentinel  |  index    |
| --------: | --------: | --------: | --------: | --------: |
|       10	|   0.00	|  0.00	    | 39.67	    |  0.00     |
|  5000000	|  869.59	| 344.43	| 449.31	|  79.38    |
| 10000000	| 1704.08	| 711.43	| 906.12	| 148.91    |


You can see that, when the value is early in the list, they all run quickly.
They differ in terms of the amount of time it takes to complete searches
for values later in the list. 
The ```while``` loop search takes much longer than the others. 
The ```for``` loop is a little faster than the sentinel search. 
The built-in method ```lst.index``` dominates them all 
but perhaps this is an unfair comparison because 
built-in functions are often compiled in a lower-level language, 
such as C++ or FORTRAN. 

## Binary Search

So far, the searching algorithms we have considered assume an unsorted list.
In this linear search, we have to check *every single value* 
until we find what we are looking for. 

If we had a *sorted* list to start with, we could speed up the search considerably. 
Consider this: if we were searching for a value in a sorted list
of a million values, we could first check the middle value. 
If that value is lower than what we are looking for, 
we have already ruled out 500,000 values! 

This algorithm is analogous to the *bisection method* that we used last week 
to solve for the roots of equations. 
We are essentially solving for the "root"" of the "function"
```lst - value```. 

Binary search and the bisection method work like the game of 20 questions, 
except all 20 questions are of the form "Is the value in this range?"
The secret to the power of this method to zoom in quickly on the value
is the application of logarithms. 
A *logarithm* of a number is how many times that number can be divided until we get 1. 
For example, the log (base 2) of 4 is 2. 

The log (base 2) of 16 is 4.

The log (base 2) of 64 is 6.

The log (base 2) of 256 is 8.

The log (base 2) of 1024 is 10. 

Continuing on, 2 raised to the power 20 is over a million, 
so the log (base 2) of a million is less than 20. 
This means that with 20 questions, we can find a value 
in a sorted list of a million candidate values. 

This is a good time to review the workings of 
the bisection method for solving roots. 
The analogue for the search problem is in the following program. 



```python 
from typing import Any

def binary_search(L: list, v: Any) -> int:
    """Return the index of the first occurrence of value in L, or return
    -1 if value is not in L.

    >>> binary_search([1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10], 1)
    0
    >>> binary_search([1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10], 4)
    2
    >>> binary_search([1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10], 5)
    4
    >>> binary_search([1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10], 10)
    7
    >>> binary_search([1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10], -3)
    -1
    >>> binary_search([1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10], 11)
    -1
    >>> binary_search([1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10], 2)
    -1
    >>> binary_search([], -3)
    -1
    >>> binary_search([1], 1)
    0
    """

    # Mark the left and right indices of the unknown section.
    i = 0
    j = len(L) - 1

    while i != j + 1:
        m = (i + j) // 2
        if L[m] < v:
            i = m + 1
        else:
            j = m - 1

    if 0 <= i < len(L) and L[i] == v:
        return i
    else:
        return -1

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()

``` 

Notice that we have an exhaustive list of test cases 
because the algorithm is quite complicated. 
Our tests cover these cases:
- The value is the first item. 
- The value occurs twice. We want the index of the first one. 
- The value is in the middle of the list.
- The value is in the last item. 
- The value is smaller than everything in the list. 
- The value is larger than everything in the list. 
- The value isn't in the list, but it is larger than some and smaller than others. 
- The list has no items. 
- The list has one item.

### Binary Search Running Time

Now we can compare the binary search lalgorithm to the 
built-in ```list.index``` method. 

```python 
import time
import binary_search


def time_it(search, L, v):
    """ (function, list, object) -> number

    Time how long it takes to run function search to find
    value v in list L.
    """

    t1 = time.perf_counter()
    search(L, v)
    t2 = time.perf_counter()

    return (t2 - t1) * 1000.0


def print_times(v, L):
    """ (object, list) -> NoneType

    Print the number of milliseconds it takes for linear_search(v, L)
    to run for list.index, the while loop linear search, the for loop
    linear search, and sentinel search.
    """

    # Get list.index's running time.
    t1 = time.perf_counter()
    L.index(v)
    t2 = time.perf_counter()
    index_time = (t2 - t1) * 1000.0

    # Get the other three running times.
    binary_time = time_it(binary_search.binary_search, L, v)

    print("{0}\t{1:.4f}\t{2:.4f}\t{3:.2f}".format(
            v, index_time, binary_time, index_time / binary_time))

L = list(range(10000001))  # A list with just over ten million values

print_times(10, L)  # How fast is it to search near the beginning?
print_times(5000000, L)  # How fast is it to search near the middle?
print_times(10000000, L)  # How fast is it to search near the end?

``` 


On my machine, it returned:

|  Length   |  index    |  binary   | ratio    |
| --------: | --------: | --------: | -------: |
|       10	|   0.0014	| 0.0328	|     0.04 |
|  5000000	|  74.6748	| 0.0120	|  6228.61 |
| 10000000	| 148.2985	| 0.0109	| 13566.79 |

The results are impressive. 
Binary search is much faster and is equally fast regrdless of the 
location of the value in the list. 


Keep in mind that this is an unfair comparison, 
since the ```list.index``` method also works for unsorted lists, 
so it doesn't take advantage of the sorted list. 
Still, this is a good reason to investigate algorithms for sorting, 
which we will do in the next lecture.
