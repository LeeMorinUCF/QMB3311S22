/*
    Create FirstTable table with variables: KeyID, Date and Name.
    The primary key is KeyID.

    Note that the slash-star symbol creates comments for a header.
    It doesn't count as a first command.
    Also, the semicolon is also used in SQL to denote end of line.
    Also, note that the cur.execute() command from sqlite3
    in Python can only execute one SQL command
    at a time.
