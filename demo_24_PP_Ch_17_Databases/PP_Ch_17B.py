### Self-Joins
##################################################

# Now, let's consider the problem of comparing some values from a table
# to other values drawn from the same table. 
# This can be achieved using a *self-join*. 
# You treat two instances of tables drawn from the same root table
# as separate tables that can be joined together, 
# as you could with any other pair of tables. 

# Suppose we want to find pairs of countries whose populations 
# are close to each other--say, within 1,000 of each other. 

# Our first attempt might look like this: 


cur.execute('''SELECT Country FROM PopByCountry
                   WHERE (ABS(Population - Population) < 1000)''')
# <sqlite3.Cursor object at 0x102e3e490>
cur.fetchall()
# [('China',), ('DPR Korea',), ('Hong Kong (China)',), ('Mongolia',),
# ('Republic of Korea',), ('Taiwan',), ('Bahamas',), ('Canada',),
# ('Greenland',), ('Mexico',), ('United States',)]

# Compare to the query without the where clause.
cur.execute('''SELECT Country FROM PopByCountry
            WHERE 1''')
cur.fetchall()




# This is not what was wanted, for two reasons: 
# - First, the phrase ```SELECT Country``` is going to return only one country per record, but we want pairs of countries.
# - Second, Second, the expression 
# ```(ABS(Population - Population) < 1000)``` is always going to return zero
# because it compares every population agains itself, line-by-line. 
# Since they will all be zero, the query will return all the country names in the table. 


# What we want to do is compare the population in each row with the populations 
# of countries in other rows. 
# To do this, we need to join ```PopByCountry``` with itself using an ```INNER JOIN```. 

cur.execute('''
SELECT A.Country, B.Country
FROM   PopByCountry A INNER JOIN PopByCountry B
WHERE  (ABS(A.Population - B.Population) <= 1000)
AND    (A.Country != B.Country)''')
# <sqlite3.Cursor object at 0x102e3e490>
cur.fetchall()
# [('Republic of Korea', 'Canada'), ('Bahamas', 'Greenland'), ('Canada',
# 'Republic of Korea'), ('Greenland', 'Bahamas')]



# It is often more clear if you use the AS keyword
# when defining an alias for a table. 

cur.execute('''
SELECT 
    pop1.Country AS Country1, 
    pop2.Country AS Country2
FROM   
    PopByCountry AS pop1 
    INNER JOIN 
        PopByCountry AS pop2
WHERE  
    (ABS(pop1.Population - pop2.Population) <= 1000)
    AND    
        (pop1.Country != pop2.Country)''')
# <sqlite3.Cursor object at 0x102e3e490>
cur.fetchall()


# But SQL is flexible and is not case-sensitive.
cur.execute('''
SeLEct 
    poP1.Country AS Country1, 
    pop2.Country AS Country2
FROM   
    popbycountry AS pop1 
    INNER JOIN 
        PopByCountry AS pop2
WHERE  
    (ABS(pop1.Population - pop2.Population) <= 1000)
    AND    
        (pop1.Country != pop2.Country)''')
# <sqlite3.Cursor object at 0x102e3e490>
cur.fetchall()



# Notice that we used the absolute value function ```ABS()```. 
# Without this, the ```WHERE``` clause would also return other pairs
# of countries where the second country is much larger than the first, 
# i.e. where the difference ```A.Population - B.Population``` would be negative. 



##################################################
# Nested Queries
##################################################


# Instead of pulling from a table, you can replace 
# the name of a table with a query that produces the required table. 

# Example: Select the list of regions that do not have 
# a country with a population of 8,764,000.



# Information:
cur.execute('''SELECT *
                   FROM PopByCountry''')

cur.fetchall()


# When you include the ```WHERE``` clause to exclude Hong Kong, 
# it also excludes Hong Kong from the list of countries in that region. 


cur.execute('''SELECT *
                   FROM PopByCountry
                   WHERE (PopByCountry.Population != 8764)''')

cur.fetchall()


# First attempt:
cur.execute('''SELECT DISTINCT Region
                   FROM PopByCountry
                   WHERE (PopByCountry.Population != 8764)''')

cur.fetchall()
# Notice the mistake: Hong Kong does have a population of 8,764,000
# but Eastern Asia is still included. 


# As an intermediate step, create a query that creates a table that 
# lists the Regions that do have a country with a population of 8,764,000.

# These are the other rows of the table. 
cur.execute('''
SELECT DISTINCT Region
FROM PopByCountry
WHERE (PopByCountry.Population = 8764)
''')
cur.fetchall()


# Now nest this within the table for the nested query. 
cur.execute('''
SELECT DISTINCT Region
FROM PopByCountry
WHERE Region NOT IN
    (SELECT DISTINCT Region
     FROM PopByCountry
     WHERE (PopByCountry.Population = 8764))
''')

cur.fetchall()

# The bracketed expression is a query that produces a table, 
# which is then passed to the nesting query, 
# much like the way you pass a calculated expression as an argument 
# to another function.

# Close the connection when finished. 
# con.close()

# If you want to save that progress,

#--------------------------------------------------

# In this example, we will create a table 
# to store the population and land area of the provinces and
# territories of Canada, according to the 2001 census with Statistics Canada. 


# a. Create a new database called census.db.

# You would import some kind of API 
# to interact with the database
# We will continue using sqlite3
import sqlite3 as dbapi
con = dbapi.connect('census.db')



# b. Make a database table called Density that will 
# hold the name of the province or territory (TEXT), 
# the population (INTEGER), 
# and the land area (REAL). 


cur = con.cursor()
cur.execute('''CREATE TABLE Density(Province TEXT,
 Population INTEGER, Area REAL)''')

# c. Insert the data from the table above.
